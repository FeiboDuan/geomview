1.7.7   August 22, 2000
   Added some of the external modules to the distribution, but haven't
   actually tested them.

   Updated the documentation to reflect the fact that the geomview-users
   mailing list is now hosted at lists.sourceforge.net.

1.7.6   May 25, 2000
   Converted source tree (geomview only; no external modules yet)
   to use GNU autoconf
   
   gv_rawevent now actually is passed an 'unsigned long' (which
   is what it expected all along, but previous was passed an
   'int') for the time value.  This had been causing mouse
   motions to fail on 64bit RS6000 running AIX 4.3.2.
   	
   Many function prototypes fixed, and other warnings turned up
   by 'gcc -Wall' fixed.  (Most of them had to do with functions
   that were implictly declared to return an int not returning
   a value).
   	
   Changed Geomview's X application name from "gv" to "geomview",
   to avoid possible conflicts with other applications named "gv,
   such as ghostview.  This affects the name used for X resources
   that apply to Geomview.  If you want to force Geomview to use
   the old "gv" name for backward compatability, set the environment
   variable GEOMVIEW_X_NAME=gv in the "geomview" shell script (be
   sure to 'export' this variable too).

1.7 February 13, 2000
   This version of the software is the same as 1.6.1p9d; the only
   difference is in the documentation, which has been substantially
   changed to reflect the fact that the Geometry Center is now closed
   and that the new home for Geomview is http://www.geomview.org.

1.6.1p9d  August 18, 1998

   Fixed coloring of N-D OFF objects noted by James Lawrence.

   Fixes to many obscure bugs and great wads of lint, suggested by
   David Kaelbling of SGI.

1.6.1p8  March 13, 1998

   Fixes to compile with GNU glibc, and on Linux under non-x86 machines.

   Geomview panels: don't limit FOV < 180 if in orthographic mode.

   Fix more bugs in anytooff: convert VECTs even if appearance suppresses
	faces and edges; preserve edgecolor property in vects.

   Fix togeomview "Bad address" error: execvp() with no trailing NULL!

1.6.1p7  November 20, 1997

   Geomview:
     Fix egregious vertex-picking bug, present in all earlier 1.6.1 versions,
     where the returned vertex index was wrong (it returned one of the
     adjacent vertices instead).

     Include lighting properly in saved .rib files.

     Use OpenGL texture_object extension if available; this improves
	multiple-texture performance dramatically on some systems.

     Automated making multiple gvx binary versions (MESA, native, etc.).

   Distribute MapleV4 version of gvplot as well as earlier ones.
   Thanks to Loris Renggli, loris@math.fsu.edu, for supplying a patch.
   Repaired  geomview/x11/geomview-x11 script so its Makefile can
   customize it properly again (broken in 1.6.1p6).

   Fix togeomview, which sometimes could fail spuriously with "Bad address".

1.6.1p6  August 29, 1997

   Geomview:
	Now seems to work, more or less, with lesstif.
	Avoid crashing in X11 renderer: work around DEC Alpha cc and gcc bugs.
	Don't draw into iconified windows, even if told to redraw via GCL.
	Postscript-save mode produces postscript which doesn't fail
	    when invoked with non-empty Postscript stack.
	New "ppmmesa" snapshot type.  If compiled with MESA OpenGL-like
	    library, allow arbitrary-res off-screen rendering using
	    (snapshot CAMID FILENAME ppmmesa ...)
	 Presence of this indicated by "(MESA)" in (geomview-version) string.
	Allow control over texture-mapping quality (interpolated or not).
	Try to produce usable display colors (not all black) on 8-bit Indigos.
	 I'm told this still doesn't work, though.
	   
	geomview script accepts "-opengl", "-mesa", "-x11" etc. flags,
	    and selects alternate gvx.{OGL,MESA,X11} binaries if installed.

   anytooff handles "dice" appearance tag for Bezier & Sphere objects,
	and gets the right color for colored VECTs.

   emodule_wish.sh script sets tcl/tk envariables, making it easier
     for emodules to use "wish".

   Make math2oogl really, really turn off non-blocking mode on its named pipe.

   vrml2oogl now invokes gzip to read compressed files,
	passes color into OOGL edgecolor as well as surface color, and
	handles text by invoking "hvectext".

   OOGL library changes:
     prototypes at last for geometry functions.
     new cleaner way to organize mg lights; they're now shared and refcounted.
     
   
1.6.1	 December 10, 1996

   Source distribution no longer uses GL-based FORMS library.
   Geomview's X/Motif interface is now the primary version,
   which the manual now describes.  Many modules rewritten
   by Nils McCarthy, Tim Rowley, and others using Tcl/Tk.  Many FORMS-based
   external modules adapted to use XForms (object libraries available from
   ftp://laue.phys.uwm.edu/pub/Xforms; see INSTALL).

   This release finally supports the extensions needed for Tamara Munzner's
   weboogl package.

  Known problems:

   Many changes aren't mentioned in this CHANGES file (though I think the
   significant ones are).

  Porting:

   Should now work under FreeBSD, and HP-UX 10.x.
   Has been tried in some new environments, including Sun UltraSparc with
   Creator3D card under Open GL, and Mesa Open-GL-like clone under Linux and
   HP-UX.  Various portability problems fixed in the source code.

  Modules:

   Some modules from earlier releases are omitted here:

     PS Snapshot's functionality is superceded by Geomview's PS Save mode.
     4dview is superceded by NDview, and in any case it depends on some
	GL-based FORMS code which hasn't been ported.
     Crayola, Warp, and parts of NDview depend on old FORMS code.

   Some new modules are added:

     Crayola, NDview, NDdemo, and Labeler are now in Tcl/Tk.
	You'll need to install Tcl/Tk in order to compile them; see INSTALL.

     Also in Tcl/Tk are some new N-dimensional utilities by Brian Luense:
	3D-Snapshot (save a projected copy of the current N-D object),
	Colormap (interactive N-D colormap controls), and
	Slicer (N-dimensional clipping).

    FORMS modules were only minimally ported to X-Forms.  You can't use
	the new Forms designer to change their interfaces, since the new
	designer writes .c files in an incompatible (though superior) way.
	The FORMS section in the Geomview manual needs to be updated.

  Applications:

    New "vrml2oogl" and "oogl2vrml" converters, written by Daeron Meyer
    and Tamara Munzner respectively.  "vrml2oogl" uses the C++ QvLib library,
    included here; if you use GNU g++ to compile it, it seems to require 2.7.2.

    "anytooff" now more efficient on large data sets, and preserves
    appearance information where possible.

    Maple graphics now pay attention to color, and can now be displayed on
    remote computers; see doc/gvplot.doc.

    New command-line text generator "hvectext" uses Hershey stroke fonts.

    Benchmarks for various platforms, with a Makefile to run your own,
	are in data/speedtests.


  Geomview graphics:

   Supports Open GL as well as GL and X renderers.  Future development will
   most likely focus on Open GL.

   Texture mapping available in GL and Open GL (but not plain X11) renderers.
   Texture coordinate must be explicitly specified.  Images may be sgi,
   ppm/pgm/pbm, or tiff or gif if netpbm toolkit installed.
   See data/geom/textured/* for some examples.

   New built-in PostScript renderer by Tim Rowley replaces PS Snapshot
   module -- respects appearances, but still uses only painter's algorithm
   for hidden-surface removal.

   New in-memory renderer (related to X renderer) writes arbitrary-size
   PPM images of geomview scenes.

   Single/double-buffered switching works in Motif version too.

   You can specify an image as a window background.

   X11 renderer on 8-bit colormapped displays defaults to 5x5x5 color cube,
   to leave more color-table slots available.  New GEOMVIEW_COLORLEVELS
   environment variable may be set to "6" to get the old 6x6x6 behavior.

   Some binary distributions include two geomview binaries, both
   bin/*/gvx with X11 renderer, and bin/*/gvx.OGL, with Mesa OpenGL-clone
   libraries.  "geomview -opengl" invokes the Open GL version.

  OOGL data formats:

   More-robust geometry parser never backtracks on valid input,
   and should now reliably read data from pipes (rather than almost-reliably
   as before).  "Lincoln" objects no longer supported.

   New "origin" and "location" fields in INSTs allow fixing objects in
   screen or camera or etc. coordinates, e.g. to paste text or UI elements
   onto objects or onto the screen.  (No built-in geomview text yet, though.)

   "input-translator" command allows specifying an external program to
   translate a file beginning with a particular string into OOGL format.
   This hack lets us read ASCII VRML files directly using vrml2oogl.

   New appearance attributes for texture-mapping, concave polygons,
   shaded lines, back-face culling, Bezier patch dicing.

  Geomview command language:

   (snapshot ...) commands -- except SGI format -- allow piping PPM or
   PostScript data to a shell command as well as writing to a file.
   PPM images may be arbitrary size.

   (background-image ...) puts an image up as a window background.

   (pick-invisible ...) lets picking depend on appearance
   (though the default is still to ignore appearances).

  Geomview UI:

   Keyboard shortcuts work in Motif panels!
   Single ESC no longer exits from geomview; use ESC ESC.
   Motif panels are now resizable.

   GL/FORMS user interface is no longer available in this release.

   Now terminates cleanly, notifying any running modules,
   if sent interrupt/hangup/terminate signals.

  Geomview documentation:

    Manual now included in HTML form (see doc/geomview_toc.html)
    as well as Texinfo and (in binary packages) Postscript.

    Manual updated to describe the Motif user interface.
    It also includes a Tcl/Tk sample module, though without commentary.
    The commentary for modules using the FORMS library is no longer accurate,
    though probably still somewhat useful.



1.5	October 21, 1994

   Source distribution now includes support for generic X/Motif
	(Sun, HP-UX, Linux, probably other systems) as well as SGI
	and NeXT graphics.

   Geomview motions:

     INCOMPATIBLE bug fix in the GCL command language:
	Motions defined with respect to the object itself, e.g.
	 (transform world world world translate 0 0 1)
	had been interpreted with the wrong sign.  This is now fixed.
	Application programs which depended on this bug (including gvclock
	and stereo) need to change accordingly.

     Documentation fix: GCL rotations (transform/transform-incr/transform-set)
	are given in radians, not degrees.

     New motion-animation commands:
	The (transform ...) command now allows a simple form of animation.
	If given an amount of time, it arranges to move by exactly that amount
	during approximately that many seconds, either at constant speed
	or with smooth start and stop.

     Scaling now happens with respect to the selected "center" object,
	not the object's own origin.  There's a new (transform ... scale ...)
	subcommand.

   Keyboard input:
     New (event-keys) and (event-pick) commands can suppress geomview
	interpreting keyboard input as commands and rightmouse-clicks as
	picking, in graphics windows.  Useful for modules which want to impose
	their own interpretations on events.

   Non-Euclidean spaces:
     Newly created cameras now correctly live in the current (possibly
	non-Euclidean) space.   They had been always Euclidean,
	despite misleading window titles.
	
   N-D projection:
     New "nOFF" object is a collection of 0-, 1- or 2-dimensional polygons
	in N-dimensional space.
     N-D coloring projection axes can be with respect to any coordinate system.

   Two-sided surface coloring:
     The "backdiffuse" material field, if defined, is interpreted as the
	reverse-side's diffuse color.  Works whenever software shading
	is enabled (i.e. always on generic-X systems); also works on those
	SGI systems whose hardware supports two-sided GL lighting.  There's
	no control panel for this feature yet but GCL commands can, e.g.
	(merge-ap world { material { backdiffuse .7 .5 0 } })


   There were a number of portability improvements in the X version,
	fixing bugs for Sun/Solaris, HP-UX, Linux, DEC OSF, AIX.

   Code is now more careful to avoid floating-point exceptions, which
	cause trouble on some machines.

   Yacc and lex, which were needed for one library, are no longer essential.



   Substantial improvements to the 3D graphics in the X11 version of Geomview:
	- Uses X Shared Memory extension (when available) for
		quick rendering of polygons and lines to X11 framebuffer
	- Support for 1, 8, or 24 bit deep X displays added
	- Optional dithering for 8 bit displays
	- Dithers 1 bit displays
	- Optional zbuffering (for hidden line/surface removal) added
	- Smooth shading added
	- Support for line thickness > 1 added
	- Clipping planes added

   Numerous fixes/additions to the X11 Geomview Motif interface:
	- Window positioning commands work (under most window managers)
		except for the Load and Save panels
	- fixed edit menu
	- added ability to type in RGB values in color panel
	- added numeric displays for sliders on material panel
	- added option menu on camera panel for choosing
		hidden surface removal method
	- added toggle button on camera panel for activating/deactivating
		dithering of colors (only shows up in 8 bit mode)

   Unlike the beta-release X graphics, the new version transmits complete
	images, not polygons, to the X server.  It's faster for local
	displays; can be slow when the display-to-geomview connection
	traverses a slow network link.

   New associated packages:

    gvplot/writeoogl, a Maple package for displaying Maple 3-D graphics
	objects in Geomview or saving them as OOGL files.  See doc/gvplot.doc.

    clip, a new command-line program based on Ginsu.  Allows clipping
	OOGL objects against spheres and cylinders as well as planes.


1.4.3   July 24, 1994

   Most changes since 1.4.2 were to fix minor bugs & improve portability.

Documentation
   Documented the OOGL "COMMENT" object.  Clarified explanation of transparency.

Geomview
   New ui-freeze command (effective on SGI only) allows suspending/resuming
     updates to UI panels, for decent performance when lots of things are
     changing.

   Portability mods: ensure FNDELAY is defined; pass the proper
     argument type to wait3/waitpid (union wait vs int).

   Fix ``normalization'' command; it had failed on "all" and "keep".

   Fix ``ND-xform-get'' command; it had returned the inverse of the
     correct matrix.

   Make ``set-conformal-refine'' command process its arguments properly.

   Call proper version of setpgrp() when spawning external modules;
     ensures we can properly kill them when exiting.
   Work around lost SIGCHLD signals when we kill an e-module invoked with
     ``(emodule-run exec program ...)''; this caused geomview to hang when
     trying to quit while such a module was running.
   Erase comm link (named pipe/socket) if it already exists but is of the
     wrong type (-M option).  ["togeomview" and "math2oogl" fixed similarly.]


OOGL libraries
   COMMENT objects can't be picked.  (Due to bugs fixed here, scenes with
	COMMENTs could sometimes yield totally spurious pick results.)

   Compute bounding spheres of 3-D objects properly, even when not normalized
     to w=1.  Affects geomview's Look command.

   Draw N-D SKEL objects even when not in N-D mode.
   Maintain mg drawing flags correctly, so driver applies proper colors, etc.,
     when drawing SKEL and VECT objects.

   Draw SPHERE objects with degenerate corner at x=1, so the Bezier normals
     come out right.

   Allow binding an appearance to a reference to a handle, e.g.
     { appearance { +edge } : fred }, by inserting an INST to hold the handle.

   Concentrate all stdio dependencies in src/lib/oogl/util/futil.c.
     Handle Linux 1.0.

   Implement acosh() correctly!

X graphics
    Allow drawing into subregions of the graphics window; needed for stereo.


External modules

 PSSnap
   Make isolated points visible.
   Ensure lightness values don't exceed 1.0.

 mgexample
   Handle lighting properly.  Allow giving data file on command line.

Configuration
   New "make clobber" rule cleans and removes targets (except libraries).
    Handy for saving space after building & installing the source distribution.

   "all" is now the sole first target in Makerules.src, to avoid confusing
	RS/6000 make.

   Expect Motif include files in /usr/include/X11/Xm/... on HP-UX.
   Define default settings for CPLUSPLUS (compiler name) for SGI and RS/6000.

   Compile on RS/6000 with "-ma" flag to allow unrestricted use of alloca().

   SunOS 4.x: set "BSD" flag, initially for choosing version of setpgrp().

   Finish incorporating SYSLIBS, etc. macros into makefiles.

   Omit -lXt when linking with mgexample, to avoid spurious link errors on Sun.



1.4.2  April 20, 1994

Beta X11 source distribution supports HP PA-RISC, DEC Alpha, RS/6000,
    Solaris, and Linux (0.99), in addition to SunOS 4.x.

New external modules:
    SGI version:
	Maniview	  (3-manifold viewer),
	NDview and NDdemo (N-dimensional viewer and demonstration program)

    X11 version now includes Animate and PS Snapshot modules.

Configuration

   Make SYSLIBS, SYSXLIBS, etc. settings -- set in makefiles/mk.* files --
       be used when compiling all programs.  Ditto for ALLOOGLLIBS,
       so new OOGL libraries can be added in one place.

Geomview

   Picking now works in X11 Geomview.

   Maintain reference counts better, avoiding memory leaks.
   Fix various cases that caused core dumps:
	- (interest ...) command entered in the Command panel
	- sending message to an external module started with -start option.
	- (echo (ND-xform ...))

   Make RIB snapshotting work in conformal and N-D viewing modes.
   (dimension) command now returns the correct setting, and
	(dimension N) does nothing if we're already in that dimension.
   Correctly choose a new current camera when the "focus" camera is deleted.
   Don't crash when sending messages to an external module started with -start
	command-line option.

   Make a crude estimate of bounding-box size for N-D objects, so "Look At"
       can begin to work.  It's only roughly right, and that only for objects
       roughly centered on the origin.
   Automatically switch all cameras into N-D mode when (dimension) is set,
	if (ND-axes) have not yet been specified.
   New (ND-xform-get) command returns N-D transform between two objects.
   More documentation on ND-axes, ND-xform, ND-color commands.

SGI Geomview (actually FORMS library)
   Add X copy/paste facility to FORMS text input fields.
       [Source for FORMS changes is available from ftp.geomview.org
	in pub/forms-2.0+.all.tar.gz]

NeXT Geomview
   Deactivate color panel while changing its color -- don't be fooled into
       thinking the user selected a new color.

PS Snapshot
   Make isolated points visible.
   Draw uncolored points and lines in black; default had been nearly white,
	almost invisible.

Mathematica -> OOGL converter
   Add an XDisplay option, allowing mathematica to run on one machine,
	geomview on another, and send geomview's X display to a third machine.
   Handle escaped newlines in Mathematica's output, preventing strange
	parsing errors.

OOGL libraries
   New N-dimensional OOGL object types: nSKEL and nMESH.
   pick.h now correctly describes interpretation of pick arguments, and
	gives brief usage example.
   Waste less memory when loading Quads.  malloc(big)/realloc(small) can lose!
   GL graphics: leave mixed-model GL/X windows alone.
   Next graphics: allow setting window depth; allow lights to live in other
	coordinate systems.
   New "keepcolor" appearance keyword tags objects as being immune to N-D
	recoloring.
   OOGL objects containing an appearance attached to a handle/file reference
	now work correctly, rather than modifying the handle;
	the reference is silently wrapped in an INST.
   Various minor bug & portability fixes.


1.4.1  November 9, 1993

Distribution includes both NeXT and SGI versions.

    New modules included:
	crayola  (SGI and NeXT) coloring program
	warp	 (SGI and NeXT)	interactive object warping
	ndviewer (SGI only)	N-dimensional viewer (currently only 4D objects)
	cplxview (SGI only)	graphs of complex functions
	clipboard (SGI only)	cut, copy and paste objects
	drawbdy	   (SGI and NeXT) find and draw the boundary of an object
	flythrough (SGI only)	Not Knot hyperbolic 
	gvclock   (SGI and NeXT) 3D clock, demonstrates real-time motion
	maniview  (SGI only)	3-manifold viewer
	trigrp	  (SGI only)    explore triangle symmetry groups
    plus source for all the existing modules.


Documentation:
    New manual!  doc/geomview.tex (TeX version) and doc/geomview-*
	(GNU texinfo version) explain Geomview in far more detail than
	previous documentation.  They strictly describe Geomview on the Iris,
	but much also applies to the Next.
		
Configuration:
    SITE makefile variable selects one of several site-specific
	configuration settings, namely installation directories for binaries
	(BINDIR), manual pages (MANDIR), and Mathematica scripts
	(MMAPACKAGEDIR).  Settings stored in
	makefiles/mk.site.{default,private,public}.  ``make instprivate''
	and ``make instpublic'' are ``make install'' variants that use the
	latter two.

    Prevent 'make' from failing if C++ compiler isn't present; just don't
    compile the C++ programs.


Geomview, General:

    Extend implementation of conformal transformations.
	Conformal mode, which had been allowed only in hyperbolic space,
	is now also meaningful in Euclidean space, where it amounts to
	inversion in the unit sphere, and spherical space, where it's
	a stereographic projection from the 3-sphere into Euclidean 3-space.
	New command (set-conformal-refine).

    Read both ~/.geomview and ./.geomview, in that order.

    New -noinit command-line option suppress reading all .geomview files.

    Implement Olaf Holt's design for N-D viewing by projection.
	New commands (ND-axes) (ND-xform) (ND-color).
	(Invoked by ndviewer and cplxview modules.)

    Keep track correctly of which window the mouse is in.
	Had sometimes gotten confused if a window was uncovered.

    Allow disabling "override" status.  New Override button & (ap-override)
	command selects whether appearance controls should suppress
	objects' own settings, or just provide default values.

    New (camera-prop) command allows setting the object used to show cameras
	when "Draw Other Cameras" selected (e.g. see file "camera-frustum").

    Mention Next variants to mouse usage (alt + left = middle, etc.)
	in Help message.

SGI Interface:
    Add transparency controls to materials panel.
	(No transparency supported on NeXT.)

    Color picker has numeric RGB input.

    Buttons for motion controls (Obscure) and Override control (Appearance).

    Add focal length and software shading controls to camera panel.
	"vl" keyboard shortcut sets camera focal length.

    Limit picked projected Z values to -1 .. +1, so we can only pick things
        that lie between the clipping planes!


Motions:
    Really stop motions of objects when we reset them.

    Controllable inertia, constrained motion, own-coordinate-frame motion
	('ui', 'uc', 'uo' key sequences).

    Make more use of the ``focal plane''.  Look At button sets focal distance.
	Shift-rightmouse-click selects a focal point; also becomes center of
	rotation.  Translations are interpreted as at the focal plane,
	so objects at the focal distance should move with the mouse.

    Use ordinary, no longer scaled, translations.
        Let the scaling be based on the frame camera's focal length,
        set e.g. by Look or etc. operations.

    Pay attention to window aspect ratio and camera focal length when moving.

    Add more parameters to (look-encompass-size ...) indicating desired margins
	for setting near and far clipping planes.


Geomview, Graphics:
    Pay proper attention to override bits in Next and RenderMan drawing
	libraries; ensures that objects will be the color chosen on the panel.

    Position SGI windows in exactly the specified place.

    Draw degenerate polylist (OFF) objects correctly for Next and RenderMan:
	use points and lines where they have 1- or 2-vertex "faces".

    Correctly handle lights whose positions don't lie within the model space
	(as the default lights are) in hyperbolic & spherical shaders.


Geomview, Saving:
    Save window positions when saving cameras in command form.
    Use a unique name when saving geom objects as commands; avoids the problem
	of saving as object X and having it automatically renamed X<n> in case
	of conflict, making further commands ineffective.

Geomview, RenderMan:
    Include both NeXT and SGI (etc) standard shader directories; we don't
        know where .rib files will be rendered.
    RenderMan saving no longer enforces adding four-digit numeric suffix.

Geomview, Communications:
    GCL command files containing multiple commands now work sensibly:
	geomview always reads entire contents, one command per display loop.
	(Use (progn ... ) to swallow all at once.)

    emodule-run command: all e-module directories are appended to $PATH
	when the program is started, so emodule-run may mention module programs
	without requiring full pathnames.

    Both SGI and NeXT versions can read from either named pipes or UNIX-domain
	sockets; -M[gc][sp] command-line option specifies data type and
	communications mechanism.


    Software shading now implements fog; density set by lighting attenconst.

    External-module programs are invoked by their full path names when possible.

    Allow L)ooking at cameras.

    Allow reading either geometry or commands from either UNIX-domain sockets
	or named pipes, using '-M[gc][sp] name' command-line option.
    (camera-prop) command specifies how to draw other cameras.
    (cursor) command (for SGI) controls GL cursor and/or loads from .pbm file.
    (setenv) command allows setting environment of e.g. external modules.

    Assorted bug fixes.


Utility programs:

    New programs ucdtooff, anytoucd convert AVS "UCD" format to/from OOGL.

    Anytooff accepts (multiple) arguments, and combines their contents.


Mathematica to OOGL software:
    Improve installation document; be more robust about locating math2oogl,
	geomview, etc. executables, and warning the user if we can't.
	Allow specifying user name when displaying on remote host.
    Don't fail if graphics contain complex values (just plot real part).
    New BezierPlot[] in BezierPlot.m allows plotting Bezier patches directly.


FORMS:
    Include FORMS-2.0-PATCHES, all differences from FORMS 2.0 release.
	Change summary:

  FORMS Library:
    New color-picker module.

    New fouraxis module, derived from positioner.c.
    Allows specifying a direction in 4-space.

    Be more intelligent about frozen forms: only redraw if
    some object changed while the form was frozen.
    Use the sign bit of the form->frozen field to tell.

    Add '@I' prefix to embed FL_ICON_STYLE (symbol font) items in a browser.

    Tie mouse (x,y) position to all mouse clicks.  Use this to ensure that we
    always register a mouse click in its correct position, not the place where
    the mouse lies when we get a chance to read it!
    Click position is fed to the next caller to ask for the mouse position
    after a click; later calls read the live mouse position.  Seems to work.

    Cache stuff as much as possible.  Don't load fonts or read color map unless
    (until) we actually need them.  Might allow programs to start up at
    a reasonable speed, since the SGI font manager is slower in 4.0.x than 3.3.

    Handle Icon font usefully -- use the Symbol font, and allow it to be scaled.
    Accommodate new font-sizing rule in IRIX 4.0.5: fonts are now
    scaled to constant real size rather than constant size in pixels.
    On IRIX 4.0.5 or greater, we discover the error this will cause and
    scale all font sizes by its reciprocal (!).

    Optimize drawing bitmaps.  Cache fl_getmcolor() values; use pointers to
    scan input & output pixel arrays.  ~sixfold speedup.  Save 64K data size.

  FORMS designer:
    Add fdesign2c, batch-mode translator from *.fd to *.{c,h}.
    Added colorwheel and fouraxis objects.


1.3.2	March 1, 1993

	Fix RenderMan file saving bug.
	New OOGL classes: discrete groups and spheres.
	Underlying support for stereo added.
	Fix replace world bug.
	Rotate about CENTERID, not the target geom, in orbit mode.
	Add slow-motion controls (invoked with Shift key).
	Scaled translation procedures now take world size into account, 
	  not distance from target object. Use this mode in fly and orbit.
        Add "emodule-defined" command: returns the given emodule's
	  shell command (& tests whether any such is defined).
	Add cull-backface as a command.

1.3.1	January 31, 1993

	IMPORTANT: the "pick" command has changed completely and is
	incompatible with previous versions.  If you have an external
	module that uses the "pick" command you should change it to
	use the new "interest" command instead.

	Change the way system-dependent information is specified;
	everything is now specified in the "geomview" shell script
	which sets environment variables and then invokes the binary.
	Nothing that is system-dependent (e.g. pathnames) are compiled
	in; not even default values.

	External modules now appear in alphabetical order in the
	applications browser.  Geomview finds out about them via files
	named .geomview-* in the modules directory, rather than in the
	system-wide .geomview file.  So there is no need to edit the
	system-wide .geomview when installing a module now.  See
	man/cat1/geomview.1 for more information on how to install a
	module.

	The space browser is now on the main panel.

	Different models of hyperbolic space are now available: virtual
	(the insider's view of the projective model), projective (outsider's
	view), and conformal-ball.  The conformal-ball model is only partially
	implemented; it works only for polylist (OFF) objects and only in
	constant-color and smooth-shading modes (not in flat-shading mode).
	The model is per-camera attribute and is settable via a browser in
	the camera panel.

	The camera, when drawn, now fits inside the unit sphere.

	Fixed RenderMan saving bug: file is now opened properly.
	
	"Fly" mode now uses scaled z-translation.

	A color wheel replaces the RGB sliders for picking colors.

	Several "look" functions added for positioning a camera to look at
	an object.  "Look At [L]" button added to tools panel positions
	the current camera to place the target object nicely in the view.
	Look At and look-encompass compute and use a bounding sphere for the
	object rather than using its bounding box.

	Add "Orbit [o]" mode.  Like fly mode, but rotates the camera
	about the center of the selected object.

	Better error reporting; syntax errors in input files are now reported
	with messages including the input line where the error was detected.

	Picking code improved; picking now works in more cases than before.
	Still broken if any part of any object is behind the camera plane.

	Null geoms now allowed, denoted { }.

	Added "interest" command which allows external modules to
	express interest in a command; the module is then notified
	whenever geomview executes the command.  Useful for modules
	that need to know when things in geomview happen.

	Reduced sensitivity to accidental mouse twitches -- it's now
	easier to make an object stop moving.

	Motion now proceeds wrt real elapsed time.  transform-incr
	allows specifying rate of motion.
	
	Control over when commands are executed: sleep-for, sleep-until,
	clock, set-clock, time-interest commands.

	A "load" command simplifies reading files.

	Added stereo viewing support: hardware, crosseyed, red/cyan modes.
	(An external module is needed to control it.)

	Lights may be specified (from command language only) in camera or
	object coordinates, as well as world coordinates.  Allows depth cueing.

	"emodule-transmit" command allows sending messages to running modules.

	"real-id" gives an object's canonical name.

	"all" gives a list of all items (geometry, emodules, ...) of a kind.

	"soft-shader" selects whether to use new software shading.
	New "v~" keyboard shortcut does, too.

	"echo" can be used to print results of evaluating lisp expressions.

	Now reads all commands from command files; used to sometimes read
	only the first command.

	Modules may continue sending messages after being killed.
	Modules receive SIGHUP signal when killed.


1.2.3	October 22, 1992

   Geomview:
	Add outside-hyperbolic space mode ("mo" keyboard shortcut).
	"mh" still selects a view inside hyperbolic space.

	A "spherical" language keyword ``(space spherical)'' is now recognized.
	Implementation of spherical motion is improved.

	Do a better job of adjusting camera setup when switching spaces.

	The first directory in the "Files" browser is initially selected,
	so its files are visible when the panel is first displayed.
	(This directory is the first one given to "load-path", by default ".").

	A new "Vects" button and "aV" keyboard shortcut select whether
	vect objects (lines and points) are visible; they're now controlled
	separately from polygon edges.

	Make hyperbolic translation behave better when the center-of-motion
	is literally "target" (the default); such translations are now along
	an axis through the origin, avoiding spurious rotation.
	If "center" is anything else, it's taken at face value.

	Use color to indicate status of Appearance-panel buttons:
	highlighted yellow when true, gray when false.
	Buttons lie flat on the panel if they've never been changed,
	and depressed if they have been.  (The "Revert [ax]" button restores
	the never-set status, and shows objects as they naturally appear.)

	Add half-baked transparency: "aT" keyboard sequence.

	Fix supersensitive behavior of Applications browser;
	running modules now appear in boldface red.

	Add "-nopanels" command-line option.

    trigrp:
	Switch between euclidean and hyperbolic space when changing groups.

    FORMS library:
	Adapt to new IRIX 4.0.5 font manager's sizing behavior.
	Since FORMS panels are fixed in pixel units, we rescale fonts
	to be constant pixel size rather than 4.0.5's constant real size.
	[Still works on older systems.]

    External modules in general:
	A list of all external-module definitions is now kept in
	"data/.geomview-modules"; it's automatically updated when
	new modules are installed in the geomview binary directory.
	It's also safe to edit this file by hand.

    General distribution:
	Distributed files are now writable by the owner, to make it
	easier to apply upgrades.  Once this 1.2.3 distribution package
	is installed, it should be possible to install future distributions
	without being the superuser, since "tar" will be able to overwrite
	the old files.


1.2.2	October 3, 1992

   Geomview:
	Repaired ANSI C incompatibilities -- this version compiles
	    under Irix 4.0.4.
	Several memory leaks were fixed.
	Don't corrupt memory when new-geometry command is used.
	Avoid crashing when a camera is deleted.
	Bezier patch dicing level is now properly recorded and
	    applied to newly loaded Bezier objects.
	Bezier's saved in RenderMan format are written as true patches,
	    not polygonal meshes.   Texture coordinates also saved for STBBP's.
	Don't lose commands sent by external modules just before they die.
	Don't continuously redraw the display when camera drawing is on.
	Make hyperbolic translation, which was approximately correct, exact.
	Repair "position", "position-at", "position-toward" commands.
	Fix -b (background color) command-line option.
	Added performance metering (control-T keyboard character).

    Libraries:
	New libformsx.a library has some handy FORMS-related functions:
	  enabling/disabling objects, reading numbers from input fields, etc.
	
	Maximum Bezier degree is now 12 rather than 6.
	Bounding boxes of Bezier patches now at least fairly meaningful.

	Avoid crashing when encountering erroneous OFF files.

	Invert the sense of QUAD normals to be consistent with other objects.

    Makefile configuration:
	Removed "make lib" warning in multiple-source library directories.
	Ensured that the FORMS library is installed by the time it's needed.
	
	
1.2.1	September 17, 1992

	Fixed a problem with src/lib/forms/Makefile which prevented
	successful compilation on systems that don't already have the
	FORMS library installed.

	1.2.1 is not really a new release --- it's just a re-packing
	of the tar file with a new src/lib/forms/Makefile.

	[ Details of the problem: modified src/lib/forms/Makefile so
	  that it installs libforms.a in bin/sgi upon "make all"
	  rather than just "make install".  This is now consistent
	  with the way the other .a files are installed, and fixes a
	  problem which prevented successful makes on systems that
	  don't already have FORMS installed.  In previous releases
	  libforms.a was installed by geomview/gl/O.sgi/Makefile
	  before it attempted to link geomview; in 1.2, however, the
	  "example" program links with libforms.a but doesn't install
	  it first.  Since "e" comes before "g", "example" is compiled
	  by "make all" before geomview, with the result that the
	  compilation fails since libforms.a is not yet in place.

	  I created geomview-1.2.1.tar.Z by unpacking the 1.2 tar file
	  into a fresh dir, replacing the files ./src/lib/forms/Makefile
	  and ./CHANGES (this file), and re-packing.  ]


1.2	September 4, 1992

Panels
------

New iconic tool panel replaces parts of old main panel. 

"Zoom" now changes camera field of view: add "scale" to change size of
geometry. (Can also change apparent size by z-translating object or
camera.)

Reorganized panels. Camera panel has camera-related things, appearance
panel has geometry-related things. Obscure panel now only has
normalization and space things.

Add save panel. Now through user interface can save: Renderman or .sgi
snapshot, text file of commands, geometry, cameras, transforms,
windows for any (or all) objects, and position information for all panels. 

Appearance controls now override all lower levels (before if lower
level had appearance of its own it was left unchanged). Added revert
button to appearance panel.

New "?" button on main panel same as "?" keyboard shortcut (dumps
keyboard shortcut summary to tty).

Add "CSmooth" mode to shading browser of appearance panel.
This is a constant-shaded style (shading depends only on vertex colors, 
not on lighting) but with smooth interpolation where colors vary across
a face.



Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

Lines-closer shortcut "ac" now also "vc" since it's a per-camera
option at the moment.

Add backface culling (only accessible through keyboard toggle "vb"). 

"g" keyboard prefix now picks world not most recently picked geometry.

"." new prefix for target object, i.e. "self". 

"P*" keyboard shortcut to bring up panels. 

"[se|sh]" shortcut changed to "[me|mh|ms]". (m for metric since s for
space got taken over by "scale"). 

"TV" toggles NTSC video mode.

"vs" toggles single vs. double-buffered windows.


Commands
-------------

Add complete help messages for all command language functions and new
commands "?" and "??".

The syntax of the write command has changed. See geomview.5.

Added position, position-at, position-toward commands. 

Added rawevent, winenter, freeze commands (intended for development
not for general use.)

External module command name changes:
emodule-define is the new name for ui-emotion-program.
emodule-start is the new name for ui-emotion-run.
emodule-run is the new name for "|".

Eliminated ui-emotion-modename: awkward event-shipping to external
modules.  More useful access to functionality that is presently hidden
internally is under development now.


Motion
-------

Totally new motion paradigm. Most old functions are mimicked. New
functionality added. Can now specify a center of motion (orbit mode
used to be camera around center of world: now can be any object
orbiting any other object. See "ui-center" command.). Can specify
rotations and translations in x, y, z instead of a raw 4x4 matrix (see
"transform*" commands).

Fly mode changed yet again: now left mouse rotates camera, middle
mouse flies camera forward/backward.

Flight Sim mode eliminated.



External Modules
----------------

Distributing external modules separately from geomview proper, except
for a few examples.

Added example external module with accompanying tutorial document.

Improved handling of external modules; can now run multiple concurrent
modules and can finally terminate them. See command language changes above. 

External modules MUST now run in the foreground, lest geomview think they've
died.  FORMS/GL modules need to call foreground().  See emodule-run
documentation in geomview(5).

Do a better job of killing off external modules when geomview exits
and suspending them when geomview is suspended.

Can now invoke external modules from geomview's command line and can
pass (globbed) parameters through to their command lines.



Geomview general
----------------

Better Renderman support, especially for automated generation of movie
frames. Can specify whether to render directly to framebuffer or to a
tiff disk file. Can give file prefix which is then autoincremented on
each Renderman snapshot. Tiff file name is constructed from rib file
name (used to always be called "image.tiff").

Snapshot pops window to prevent obscuration, and redraws in singlebuffered
mode to minimize dithering artifacts, and to avoid a "scrsave" bug which
sometimes caused the previous image to be saved.

In hyperbolic mode the camera starts out inside the sphere instead of
outside the sphere, and the bounding sphere is not automatically drawn. 

Add spherical space mode.

Add new special id's: self, universe, primitive (for coordinate systems).

Pick data can be written in any of several coordinate systems.

Make picking work on views with dedicated scenes.

Better camera geometry for default camera drawn. (Development feature
that may change in the future: uses "cam.oogl" file instead if it
exists.)

Number new objects according to their id, so camera c2 == "Camera<2>",
etc.



OOGL
----

Better error detection and recovery in OOGL loading rountines.

Added method extension mechanism for geom objects.

Various internal reorganizations --- renaming variables, etc.

Added support for variable-length arrays (vvec's).

Added geom transform methods.

Print a useful error message if a camera file can't be found.

Fixed binary mesh loading bug; binary meshes now load properly.

Fixed bug which caused sometimes-wrong screen z computation associated
   with picking.

Fixed picking of closed VECT object.

Don't draw VECTs when edge drawing is off.

Objects loaded from files are no longer tied to the contents of those files;
the sequence "load object, change file, load other object from same file"
now yields two distinct objects, not two identical copies of the new version.

General
-------

Made source code more ANSI-compliant.

Many optimizations; code runs faster.

Fixed bugs assocaited with communication via pipes; close them

Fixed bugs associated with reference counting and memory
   allocation and freeing.

New configuration setup; more robust

Overhaul Makefile structure; rely more on common Makefiles
   referenced via "include"

Completely new lisp interpreter; much more general and easier to
  use than previous version.  See the man page man/cat3/lisp.3 for
  details.

Fixed various minor bugs.



Known problems:
---------------
Spherical mode doesn't work on VGXes.

Zoom and Scale have no inertia.

Constrained motion (to X or Y axis) no longer works.

Sometimes core dumps on bad input files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1	May 27 1992

    Slightly better documentation; lang.doc renamed geomview.5.
    Four more sample external modules added.
    Control panel settings override objects' own appearances.

    Object vertex/edge/face picking (rightmouse), w/command-language feedback.
    New flight-simulator motion mode.
    More state-saving operations, 'write' and 'snapshot' language commands.
    Command-language control over windows & panels (placement, visibility).
    Can save scenes in RenderMan .rib format.

    Many bug fixes including:
      Memory should now be freed properly when objects are deleted.
      Code now compiles under IRIX 4.0.1 ANSI C.
      Input panels now accept input properly under 4.0 (input focus bug fixed).

    Known problems:
      IRIX 4.0 remote display (DGL) doesn't work; geomview must run on the
	machine where it's displaying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1	February 25 1992:	

    Miscellaneous minor bug fixes
    Slightly better documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0	January 31 1992

    initial release
