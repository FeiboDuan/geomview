Here is a segment which lies along the y
direction, so it looks like a point in the
X_W_plane.  Notice how the motion of the segment
is similar to the motion of the point.

This is the first step in the progression to the
four dimensional analogue of a cube.  A segment is
"one-dimensional" , and is the result of
connecting two points.

Press "2 segments" to continue.
