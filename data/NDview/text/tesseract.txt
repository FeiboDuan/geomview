Here is the tesseract.  It should look like two
cubes connected at the vertices, each cube
rotating in a by now familiar way.  If it makes
sense, congratulations, the rest of this demo is
just icing.

One variation is to do this whole progression
again, but with a slightly tilted tesseract.

Using the LEFT mouse button, tilt the tesseract
slightly in the X_W_plane (not the
X_Y_Z_hyperplane).

Now try the progression from a single point to the
segment and so on.  This should illustrate what's
going on when we move to more general rotations.

This concludes the explanatory text for this demo.
