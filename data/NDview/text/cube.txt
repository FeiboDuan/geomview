This cube extends in the x direction, but not in
the w direction, so the cube looks like a segment
in the x,w plane.

This picture is often a little more difficult to
digest at first glance than the previous images,
so you may want to take a look at the squares
again if it doesn't make sense.

The cube looks like it is turning inside out, as
it rotates.  This demonstrates how a rigid 3d
object can be transformed into its mirror image by
moving it through a four dimensional space.
