This square extends in the y and z directions
only, so it still looks like a point in the x,w
plane.  The square can be looked at as two
segments, joined at the ends.

You can look at these two segments individually,
by going back to "2 segments".

Up till now, the rotations we've been seeing look
sort of like normal rotations, with the object
viewed edge on.  For example, if we imagine a
planet orbiting the sun and we look at it from the
side (not from above), from very far away, the
planet may look like its just going back and forth
along a line.  But with the square, we can no
longer understand its motion as a normal 3d
rotation seen through a peculiar lens. That is,
the square extends in the y and z directions, and
its rotation involves the x and w directions, so
the animation seen in the X_Y_Z_hyperplane is not
simply a 3D rotation viewed from a particular
angle.

Press "2 squares" to continue.
