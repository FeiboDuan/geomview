DESCRIPTION
       Geomview	 is an interactive geometry viewer written at the
       Geometry Center.	 It displays the  objects  in  the  files
       given  on the command line and allows the user to view and
       manipulate them interactively.

       The present version (1.7) of geomview	runs  on  Silicon
       Graphics	 Irises,  and X Window System workstations.
       We are very interested in hearing about any  problems  you
       may  have  using	 it;  see below for information on how to
       contact us.

       In addition to providing interactive control over a  world
       of objects via the mouse and keyboard, geomview has an in-
       terpreted language of commands for controlling almost  ev-
       ery  aspect of its display.  It can execute files contain-
       ing statements in this language, and  it	 can  communicate
       with  other programs using the language.	 See geomview(5),
       e.g. the file man/cat5/geomview.5 in the geomview  distri-
       bution, for more details of the language.


TUTORIAL
       This  manual  page serves only as a (very) terse reference
       manual for geomview.  For a gentler  introduction  to  the
       program	and the format of the data files it can read, see
       "overview" and "oogltour" in the "doc"  directory  of  the
       geomview	 distribution,	or  better,  see the full manual:
       "geomview.tex" or "geomview.ps", also in the "doc"  direc-
       tory.   The  source  distribution also includes a tutorial
       for how to write external modules in the "src/bin/example"
       directory.


OPTIONS
       -opengl
	      Some  geomview  distributions  include two gvx exe-
	      cutables -- one which displays images using only	X
	      windows  graphics,  and another which uses Open GL.
	      The -opengl (or -OGL) option selects the latter, if
	      it  exists.  If used, this option must be the first
	      option given to geomview.

       -b     Set the window background color to the given r g	b
	      values.

       -c     Interpret the commands in commandfile, which may be
	      ``-'' for standard input.	 The command language  is
	      described in geomview(5).	 Commands may be supplied
	      literally, as  in	 ``-c  "(ui-panel  main	 off)"'';
	      since  they include parentheses, they must be quot-
	      ed.

       -wins  Causes geomview to initially display #windows  cam-
	      era windows.

       -wpos  Specifies	 the  initial  location	 and  size of the
	      first camera window.  With ``-'', you are	 prompted
	      for window placement.

       -M objname
	       Display	(possibly  dynamically changing) geometry
	      (or commands) sent via ``togeomview -g objname [ge-
	      omview-shell-command]'' or ``geomstuff objname file
	      ...''.  The data appears as a geomview object named
	      objname.

	      Actually	listens	 to  the  named	 pipe  ``/tmp/ge-
	      omview/objname''; you can achieve the  same  effect
	      with the shell commands:
		  mkdir /tmp/geomview;
		  mknod /tmp/geomview/objname p
	      (assuming	 the  directory	 and named pipe don't al-
	      ready exist), then executing the geomview command:
		  (geometry objname  < /tmp/geomview/objname)

       -M[cg][sp] pipename
	      The -M option accepts modifiers: a 'g'  suffix  ex-
	      pects geometry data (the default), while 'c' suffix
	      expects gcl commands.  A 'p' implies the connection
	      should  use a named pipe (the default on the Iris),
	      while 's' implies using a UNIX-domain  socket  (de-
	      fault  on	 the NeXT).  So -Mcs fred selects reading
	      commands from the UNIX-domain socket named /tmp/ge-
	      omview/fred.

       -nopanels
	      Start  up	 displaying no panels, only graphics win-
	      dows.  Panels may be invoked later  as  usual  with
	      the  "Px"	 keyboard  shortcuts  or "(ui-panel ...)"
	      command.

       -noinit
	      Read no initialization files.  By default, geomview
	      reads the system-wide ".geomview" file, followed by
	      those in $HOME/.geomview and ./.geomview.

       -e modulename
	      Start an external module; modulename  is	the  name
	      associated  with	the module, appearing in the main
	      panel's Applications browser,  as	 defined  by  the
	      emodule-define  command  (see  geomview(5)  for de-
	      tails).

       -start modulename arguments ... --
	      Like -e but allows you to pass arguments to the ex-
	      ternal  module.	"--" signals the end of the argu-
	      ment list; the "--" may be omitted if it	would  be
	      the last argument on the geomview command line.

       -run shell-command arguments ...
	      Like -start but takes the pathname of executable of
	      the external module instead of the module's name.


GEOMETRY FILE FORMATS
       The format of the files read by geomview is  described  in
       oogl(5);	  type	 "man	5   oogl",   or	  see	the  file
       man/cat5/oogl.5 in the geomview distribution, for details.

       Note  to	 users	of MinneView (the precursor to geomview):
       geomview can read MinneView files,  but	MinneView  cannot
       read all geomview files.


STARTUP FILES
       Immediately  upon  starting up geomview reads and executes
       the commands in the system-wide .geomview file in the "da-
       ta"  subdirectory  of  the  geomview  directory.	 Then, if
       there is a file named .geomview in the current  directory,
       it  executes  the commands in that file.	 If no in the us-
       er's home directory, and executes it if found. The startup
       file  of	 an  individual user overrides the systemwide de-
       faults, since later commands take precedence over  earlier
       ones.


EXTERNAL MODULES
       Geomview	 has the ability to interact via its command lan-
       guage with  other  programs,  called  "external	modules".
       Many such modules have been written and appear in the "Ap-
       plication" browser in the main geomview panel.  To  invoke
       a module you click the mouse on the module's entry in this
       browser.	 This starts the module and  adds  an  additional
       entry  to  the  browser, beginning with a number in square
       brackets as in ``[1] Crayola'', which represents the  run-
       ning  instance of that module.  You can terminate the mod-
       ule by clicking on the numbered entry.  Modules are  docu-
       mented  separately from geomview.  See the manual page for
       each module for details.

INSTALLING AN EXTERNAL MODULE
       Geomview looks for external modules in a special directory
       for  modules.   In  the geomview distribution tree this is
       the "bin/$MACHTYPE" subdirectory.  A  module  consists  of
       two  files:  the	 executable  program,  and a "module init
       file", which is a whose name is ".geomview-"  followed  by
       the  module name.  The module init file tells geomview how
       to run that program.  Be sure to	 always	 keep  these  two
       files  together;	 geomview  needs both of them in order to
       run the module.	To install a new module, simply	 put  the
       module's	 executable  file  and	its init file in your ge-
       omview's module directory.  The	next  time  you	 run  ge-
       omview, it will know about that module.

       Geomview	 can  actually looks for modules in a list of di-
       rectories; by default only the  "bin/$MACHTYPE"	directory
       is  on this list.  See the set-emodule-path command in ge-
       omview(5) for details.

       There is a tutorial for how to write external  modules  in
       the "src/bin/example" directory.


EXTERNAL MODULE INIT FILES
       An  external  module  init file is the file that tells ge-
       omview how to run that module.  Its  name  must	be  ".ge-
       omview-"	 followed  by  the name of the module, e.g. ".ge-
       omview-foo".   It should contain geomview commands;  typi-
       cally  it  will	contain	 a  single emodule-define command
       which enters the module into geomview's application brows-
       er:

	       (emodule-define "Foo" "foo")

       The  first string is the name that appears in the browser.
       The second string is the command to invoke the module.  It
       may  contain  arguments;	 in  fact  it can be an arbitrary
       shell command.



KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
       Many geomview operations are available from the	keyboard.
       Hitting	the  "?"  button on the main panel, or typing "?"
       with the cursor in any window, causes geomview to print	a
       message on standard output listing all the keyboard short-
       cuts.

       Keyboard commands apply while cursor is in any graphics window and most
       control panels. Most commands allow one of the following selection prefixes
       (if none is provided the command applies to the current object):
	  g  world geom	   g#  #'th geom  g*  All geoms
	  c  current camera	c#  #'th camera	    c*	All cameras
       Many allow a numeric prefix:  if none they toggle or reset current value.

NOTES
       The "geomview" command is actually  a  shell  script  that
       sets  various  environment  variables  which tell geomview
       about your local setup, and then invokes the geomview exe-
       cutable program "gvx" (or "gvx.OGL").  Do not run "gvx" by
       itself; always invoke geomview with the	"geomview"  shell
       script.
