<p>
The model that Geomview uses for object motions involves 3 objects
for each motion: a <i>moving</i> object, a <i>center</i> object,
and a <i>frame</i> object.  As the name suggests, the <i>moving</i>
object is the one that actually moves.  The motion happens in
an imaginary coordinate system obtained by (parallel) translating
the coordinate system of the <i>frame</i> object to the origin
of the <i>center</i> object coordinate system.
</p>

<p>
To compute and apply a motion, we think of it as happening in
this imaginary coordinate system (e.g. a ``rotation of 10 degrees around
the X axis'').  But we want to apply it to the <i>moving</i> object,
which we have in its own coordinate system.  This note explains
how to do this.
</p>

<p>
First, some notation.
Think of a Geomview world as a copy of \(\mathbb{R}^3\)
with many different coordinate system representations.  If \(S\) is a
coordinate system and \(x \in \mathbb{R}^3\) is a point, we write \([x]_S\)
to denote the coordinates of \(x\) in \(S\).  Also, if \(V: \mathbb{R}^3
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) is a projective transformation of \(\mathbb{R}^3\),
write \([V]_S\) to denote the (\(4 \times 4\)) matrix that represents
\(V\) in \(S\).  Let
</p>

<ul>
<li>\(m\)  = coord sys of moving object
<li>\(c\)  = coord sys of center object
<li>\(f\)  = coord sys of frame object
<li>\(f'\) = \(f\) translated to origin of \(c\)
<li>\(U\)  = universal coord sys
</ul>

<p>
With this notation we can now precisely state the problem: If \(V\) is a
transformation, express \([V]_m\) in terms of \([V]_{f'}\).  (We know
\([V]_{f'}\) and need to compute \([V]_m\).)
</p>

<p>
To do the computation we will need several change-of-coordinate
matrices.  If \(S\) is a coordinate system, let \(T_S\) be the matrix
which changes \(S\) coordinates into \(U\) (universal) coordinates.  So:
</p>

<ul>
<li>\([x]_U = [x]_m    \cdot T_m\)
<li>\([x]_U = [x]_c    \cdot T_c\)
<li>\([x]_U = [x]_f    \cdot T_f\)
<li>\([x]_U = [x]_{f'} \cdot T_{f'}\)
</ul>

<p>
\(T_m\), \(T_c\), and \(T_f\) can easily be computed from the position
of \(m\), \(c\), and \(f\) in the world heirarchy.  \(T_{f'}\) can
be computed as follows.
Let \(p\) be the origin of \(c\); so \([p]_c = [0, 0, 0, 1]\).
The coordinates of \(p\) in \(f\) are
</p>

$$
[p]_f = [p]_c \cdot T_c \cdot T_{f}^{-1} = [0, 0, 0, 1] \cdot T_c \cdot T_{f}^{-1}
$$

<p>
If \(P\) is the translation that takes the origin of \(f\) to \(p\), then
\([P]_f\) is the matrix whose bottom row is \([p]_f\).  Then \(T_{f'} =
[P]_f \cdot T_f\).  (Another way to think of this is that \([P]_f\) is
the matrix which changes \(f'\) coordinates into \(f\) coordinates.)
\([V]_m\) can now be computed in terms of \([V]_{f'}\) as follows:
</p>

$$
[V]_m = T_m \cdot T_{f'}^{-1} \cdot [V]_{f'} \cdot T_{f'}          \cdot T_m^{-1}
$$

$$
[V]_m = T_m \cdot T_f^{-1} \cdot {[P]_f}^{-1} \cdot [V]_{f'} \cdot [P]_f \cdot T_f \cdot T_m^{-1}
$$
