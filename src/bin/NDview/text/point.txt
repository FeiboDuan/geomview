What do I see?

When geomview is ready, you should see two
windows, labeled "X_W_plane", and
"X_Y_Z_hyperplane".  They each show a set of axes
and a point.

If you haven't already, move the slider under
"MOTION" to make the object rotate.

Notice what is happening in the X_Y_Z_hyperplane--
the point is moving along the x axis.

Use the LEFT mouse button in the X_Y_Z_hyperplane
to move it around and get a better look.  You can
move the X_Y_Z_hyperplane like this at any point
during this demo.

What's going on?

We are watching several projections of a point
moving in four dimensional space.

Click on the "Reset" button.

You will notice that the point starts out at
approximately (x=.7, y=0, z=0, w=.3).

Click "Fast" or "Slow" to make it move again.

The movement of the point in the x direction can
been seen in the projection into the
X_Y_Z_hyperplane, but its movement in the w
direction has been hidden (or "projected out").

Notice that everything has been color-coded
according to height in the w direction, so that
when the w coordinate of the point is high, the
point is colored red, and when it is low, the
point is colored blue.

Press "2 points" to continue.
