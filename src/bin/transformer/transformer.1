.SH NAME
transformer \- Tool for manipulating geomview transforms.
.SH SYNOPSIS
transformer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Transformer is a tool to manipulate the wrap transforms of
geomview objects.  When transformer is started, it will read in
the wrap transform of the target object.  The transform will
be displayed at the top of the panel.  
.PP
The displayed transform may at any time be set to the wrap 
transform of the geomview target object by pressing the "Read"
button at the bottom of the panel.  Note that the transform
does not automatically update whenever the target object moves.
The transform may also be set to the identity by pressing the 
"Identity" button at the bottom of the panel.  
.PP
The transform may also be applied to the geomview target object
by pressing the "Apply" or "Set" button.  The "Apply" button will
cause the current wrap transform of the current target object to
be postmultiplied by the displayed transform.  The "Set" button
will cause the wrap transform of the target to be replaced by the 
transform.  Note that the transform of the geomview target is
not updated automatically when the transform displayed in the panel
changes.
.PP
The displayed transform may be modified directly by changing the 
numbers in the matrix.  In addition, a rotation, translation, or
scale may be applied to the object.  To rotate the object, 
enter the appropriate number of degrees or radians in the input
field next to the "Degrees" buttons and press the "Rotate" button.
The displayed transform will then be postmultiplied by a rotation
matrix of the requested amount about the specified axis.  In a similar
fashion, the translate and scale sections of the panel may be used to
update the transform.
.PP
All operations are Euclidean.

The following keyboard shortcuts apply:

	R		Rotate
	T		Translate
	S		Scale
	a or Space	Apply
	Return		Set
	r		Read
	i		Identity
	q		Quit
.SH BUGS
.PP
The transform is read from the current target when the program begins
or the read button is pressed.  The transform of the current target is 
modified by or set to the displayed transform when the "Apply" or "Set"
button is pressed.  There is no check that the user has not changed the 
geomview target between these two operations.  Although the results of such
an operation will be correct according to the specifications in this man
page, the results may be unexpected.
