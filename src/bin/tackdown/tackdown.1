.SH NAME
tackdown \- External module for permanently transforming Geomview
objects.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tackdown
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tackdown is a tool to permanently transform objects in Geomview.
Tackdown first reads the target geometry from Geomview.  It then reads
the transform of the target geometry, and applies the transform to the
object.  The old target geometry is replaced by the transformed
version.  Once tackdown has been run on an object, centering it will
cause it to go back to the last place it was tacked down. 
.PP
Make sure the normalization is off - otherwise, Geomview will
renormalize the object and it will return to the origin.
.PP
The user may select the desired coordinate system using the buttons at
the bottom of the panel.  Note that tacking an object down in the
universe coordinate system when the transform of the world object is
not the identity may cause the object to appear to thave changed
position.  This is because the world transform is incorporated into
the universe transform.  When the new object appears, the world
transfrom will be applied to it twice:  once via the transform that
was permanently applied to it by tackdown and once by Geomview when
the object was drawn.  To get the object to reappear where you
expected it to be, set the transform of the world to the identity
matrix.
.SH BUGS
Tackdown may not be run on the world geometry.
