.TH flythrough 1 "January 29, 1993" "Geometry Center"
.SH NAME
flythrough \- Geomview external module to fly through Not Knot hyperbolic dodecahedral tesselation
.SH SYNOPSIS
flythrough [-t] [-h]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Flythrough is a geomview external module that lets you fly through
the tesselation of hyperbolic space by a right-angled regular
dodecahedron which appeared in the mathematical animation "Not Knot"
produced by the Geometry Center. You can either pick a pre-computed
flight path or fly around interactively. Click on "Not Knot
Flythrough" in the geomview Applications browser to start the program.

.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 
-t
Turbo mode: send commands off as fast as possible without waiting for
geomview to catch up.
.TP
-h
Display help window on startup.
.SH WHAT'S GOING ON
.PP
When you hit the "What's Going On?" button (or start up the module
with the -h option), you get a text help window with most of the
information in this man page. There is also a 3D diagram of a single
dodecahedron with color-coded arcs indicating the pre-computed flight
paths. You can drag the left mouse button in the window to spin this
diagram around. It's easier to see what's going on in the Euclidean
diagram, while the hyperbolic version is more similar to what you see
in the flythrough. 

.SH CONTROL PANEL
.PP
You can either choose one of four flight paths through the tesselation
or stop the automatic flight by hitting the "Stop" button and fly
around yourself.  For interactive flight, hit the "Cam Fly" button on
the geomview Tools panel: then dragging the mouse with the middle
button down moves you forwards or backwards, and dragging with the
left button down is like turning your head. When you hit "Go", the
automatic flight will continue.
.PP
You can choose one of four tesselation levels: level 0 is a single
dodecahedron, level 1 adds a layer of 12 dodecahedra (one for each
face of the original dodecahedron), level 2 tesselates two layers
deep, and level 3 has three layers. The more layers you have the
slower the update rate: level 3 is glacially slow, but each frame
looks pretty impressive. You can change the size of the dodecahedra
with the "Scale Dodecahedra" slider: at 1.0 they fit together exactly.
The "Steps" buttons control the smoothness of the flight path: you can
set the number of steps to 10 (jerky but fast), 20, 40, or 80 (smooth
but slow).
.SH FLIGHT PATHS
.PP
All 30 edges of the base dodecahedron are white except the three
pairs of edges colored green, blue and red corresponding to the three
loops of the Borromean rings. Every face of the dodecahedron has
exactly one non-white edge, so we can color the face by this color.
.PP
All flight paths begin and end at the center of a green face.  There
are three other green faces: one adjacent to this one, at right
angles along the green beam; and a pair which border the other green
beam, on the other side of the dodecahedron.
.PP
The light blue "Direct" path is the simplest to understand:
we go straight through to the green face directly opposite from the
original face.
.PP
The yellow "Quarter Turn" path, which goes to the adjacent green face,
simply circles around the green axis which the two faces share.
.PP
The "Full Loop" path is also yellow: it repeats this quarter turn four
times so that we start and finish in the same place. The three other
paths just jump back to the starting place when they reach the end.
.PP
The magenta "Equidistant" path, which goes to the other green face
which doesn't border the original face, is the most interesting.  It
follows a so-called equidistant curve: in this case, one that is
equidistant to the red axis that connects the two green faces in
question. This curve is like a parallel line in Euclidean space: it
stays a constant distant from the red axis, but it's not a geodesic in
hyperbolic space.
