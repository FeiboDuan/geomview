.SH NAME
TranslationSweep - Routine to create surfaces of extrusion.
RotationSweep - Routine to create surfaces of rotation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
Geom *TranslationSweep(float length, Point3 *p, Geom *g);
Geom *RotationSweep(float angle, Point3 *end, Point3 *axis,
		    int divisions, Geom *g);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
TranslationSweep and RotationSweep are used to create polylist objects
which are the translational sweep (surface of extrusion) or rotational
sweep (surface of rotation) of the Geom g, which must be a vect. 
.PP
TranslationSweep takes as its arguements the length and direction of
the sweep.  The returned off object will be a representation of the
Geom g swept length units in the direction of the vector p.
.PP
RotationSweep forms a surface by rotating the object g by angle units.
The angle parameter should be specified in radians.  The rotation is
about the axis specified by the endpoint end and in the direction
axis.  The surface of rotation will be divided radially into divisions
parts.  
.PP
If angle is within .01 of 2.0 * pi (as defined in math.h), it
will be assumed that a full rotation is desired.  In the returned
polylist object, the ends of the sweep will refer to the same points
to prevent a crack from appearing due to round off error.
.PP
Either routine will print out an error message and return NULL if the
Geom g is non-NULL and is not of the vect type.  Either routine will
return NULL (with no error message) if g is NULL.
