.SH NAME
sweep \- Geomview external module for creating surfaces of extrusion
and rotation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
sweep
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sweep is a tool used to make surfaces of extrusion and rotation out of
geomview vect objects.  Sweep is intended to run as a geomview
external module.  It uses the target object, which must be a vect, to
create the surfaces.  To create the surface, press the button marked
"Make Sweep" at the bottom of the panel.  The program will create the
surface and automatically send it to geomview as a new object named
"sweep." 
.PP
The two buttons at the top of the sweep panel control the type of
sweep.  If the button marked "Translational Sweep" is pressed, the
target object will be used to make a surface of extrusion.  The fields
marked "Length of sweep" and "Direction of sweep" are
used to control the attributes of the surface.
.PP
If the button at the top of the panel marked "Rotational Sweep" is 
pressed, the surface formed will be the surface of the rotation of the
vect.  The box in the middle of the panel will be replaced by a box with
controls for the attributes of the surface of rotation.
Note that the sweep may be of an arbitrary length around an
arbitrary vector.  The field marked "Arc length" controls the
length of the sweep in degrees or radians.  The fields marked "End of
axis" and "Direction axis" are used to specify the
axis around which the vect will be rotated.  The field marked
"Divisions" is used to specify the number of pieces into which the
sweep will be radially divided.  A higher number will give a smoother
appearance.
