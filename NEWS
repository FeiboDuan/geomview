1.7.7   August 22, 2000

   Added some of the external modules to the distribution, but haven't
   actually tested them.  Updated the documentation to reflect the
   fact that the geomview-users mailing list is now hosted at
   lists.sourceforge.net.

1.7.6   May 25, 2000

   This is the first release of Geomview to use GNU autoconf.  The
   autoconf script has been tested on Linux (RedHat 6.1), IRIX 6.3,
   and AIX 4.3.2.  It's untested on other platforms and may need
   tweaking to work on them.  Also, note that this release does not
   include the external modules.  If you want any of them, use an
   older release, or wait for a future one.
