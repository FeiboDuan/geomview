To create the missing files when pulling geomview directly from CVS
you have to install a recent autoconf/automake-combo. The
following versions will do, but other _might_ do as well:

autoconf-2.59
automake-1.9
libtool-1.5.22

If you have to upgrade to a more recent autoconf/automake version then
you can install autoconf _and_ automake (both of them) locally. Then
just change to the top-level source directory and issue the command:

autoreconf --install

That's all.
